          <h4>Mulan the Movie Synopsis</h4>
          <h5>22&degC (72&degF)</h5>
          <p>Fearful that her ailing father will be drafted into the Chinese military, Mulan takes his spot, though, as a girl living under a patriarchal regime, she is technically unqualified to serve. She cleverly impersonates a man and goes off to train with fellow recruits. Accompanied by her dragon, Mushu, she uses her smarts to help ward off a Hun invasion, falling in love with a dashing captain along the way.</p>

          <h4>Was Mulan based on a true story?</h4>
          <h5>205&degC (401&degF)</h5>
          <p>There is a probability that Mulan wasn't an actual person. The Disney character's story came from an ancient Chinese ballad from the Song Dynasty, called “Ode to Mulan." This poem was originally part of a musical collection of lyrics and songs that no longer exists, which makes tracing the origin difficult.</p>
