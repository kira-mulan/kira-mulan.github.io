          <h4>Mulan the Movie Synopsis</h4>
          <p>Mulan fears that her father will be drafted into the Chinese military, which she takes his spot, though, as a girl living under a patriarchal regime, she is technically unqualified to serve. She cleverly impersonates a man and goes off to train with fellow recruits. Accompanied by her dragon, Mushu, she uses her smarts to help ward off a Hun invasion, falling in love with the captain along the way.</p>

          <h4>Was Mulan based on a true story?</h4>
          <p>There is a probability that Mulan wasn't an actual person. The Disney character's story came from an ancient Chinese ballad from the Song Dynasty, called â€œOde to Mulan." This poem was originally part of a musical collection of lyrics and songs that no longer exists, which makes tracing the origin difficult.</p>
